Treehouse Techdegree Project 6: Content Scraper

Ronald van der Bergh

This is a Node.js content scraper that fetches the latest prices from http://shirts4mike.com/shirts.php and saves them to a CSV file. The application automatically runs once per day, rewriting the CSV file whenever it is run. It makes use of npm modules, has a package.json file, and automatically installs dependencies with the "npm install" command. 

For extra credit: the program runs with the "npm start" command, and errors are logged by appending to the file scraper-error.log with a time stamp and error message.
